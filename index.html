    <h2>MY LESSONS LEARNT IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING PROGRAMMING</h2>
 
   <ul><b>
<li>google is one of the greatest tool of a pragrammer</li>
<li>programming is full with frustration and you need to perfectly learn how to deal with your frustration</li>
<li>never you use words like it won't work because in programming the main aim is to make it work</li>
<li>avoid complaining and excuses it won't help you instead it will kill you in the process</li>
<li>discipline is one of the greatest characteristic a programmer must have because without you being discipline you won't make it through</li>
<li>believe in your ability never doubt yourself</l>
<li>learn everyday and always stay updated to recent changes in the programming field</li>
<li>lastly let money be the last thing focus on building a career and a legacy where people will remember you when you are no more</li>
